			<h1 class="title">Strengths and Weaknesses in terms of IT field</h1>
			<p>It is my best strength that I have a strong desire to further my studies in the field of Information Technology. In addition, I am determined to achieve my goals. I am willing to seek help and change for my errors. I know that learning is the key to growth, so learning is a very important talent in life. I appreciate learning new things and challenging myself. When I'm doing something new, I usually learn quickly and make a good work because of my determination to make it good on the first try. </p>
			<p>My biggest weakness is time management. Despite the fact that I do not work, I spend a lot of time at home. I often find myself staring at my phone, listening to music, or watching television. As a result, I lose a lot of time and am unable to complete my schoolwork. To overcome my weaknesses, I need to enhance my strengths.</p>
